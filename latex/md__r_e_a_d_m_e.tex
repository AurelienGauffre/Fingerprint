The aim of this project is to find mathematical filters and models which best simulate artefacts that could occur during the fingerprint acquisition. \subsection*{How to use the project}

Create a folder named build in the project folder. Go into this one and build the makefile with cmake. Then you can make. Finally the executable demo files are in /build/demo/. If you don\textquotesingle{}t give any argument when calling the demo files, a standard image will be used, but you can test each demo file on the image you want.


\begin{DoxyCode}
fingerprint$ mkdir build
fingerprint$ cd build
#Creatiion of the Makefile :
fingerprint/build$ cmake ..
#Make :
fingerprint/build$ make
# This is how to execute a demo file :
fingerprint/build$ ./demo/rotation\_demo
#If you want to test with a particular image, you can give it as an argument :
fingerprint/build$ ./demo/rotation\_demo ./../ressources/clean\_finger.png
# To call one of the tests :
fingerprint/build$ ./tests/test\_rotation
\end{DoxyCode}
 \+:construction\+: Warning \+:construction\+: You have to execute the demo and tests files from the build directory as described above if you want the standard images to be properly called.
